I created this repository to practice using git from: 
1. git bash, 
2. tortoise git and 
3. egit.

Please do all exercises from git bash, then when those are done, do the steps again from tortoise git and finally when those are done ... from egit.

I created the repository and added you as a member.

The initial file structure:
* practicingGit\instructions.txt
* practingGit\file2.txt
* practicingGit\folder\file1.txt

The files are one the master branch.

1. get the repository via git clone
2. create a branch called practice_git_bash (practice_tortoise_git and practice_egit)
3. edit file2.txt - add 'this is some text git bash' on line 2
4. let git know about the change (git add, git commit -m "your commit message" and git push (git push -u origin name-of-branch for the first commit after creating a branch)
5. check out the change in github.com
6. edit file2.txt - add 'this is more text git bash' on line 3.
7. let git know about the change
8. check out the change in github.com
9. merge the branch with master
10. create a branch called practice_2_git_bash
11. edit file 2.txt - change the text on line 3 to say 'this is even more text'
12. let git know about the change
13. check out the change in github.com
14. create a branch called practice_3_git_bash
15. edit file1.txt - add 'hello git bash' on line 4, edit file2.txt and add 'hello git bash' on line 8
16. let git know about the change
17. check out the change in github.com
18. merge practice_3_git_bash with master
19. go to the branch practice_2_git_bash
20. edit file2.txt and add 'hi git bash' on line 8.
21. create a file git_bash.txt in the folder folder. add text to that file.
22. let git know of the change
23. check out on github.com
24. merge with master

25. repeat 1-24 with tortoise git
26. repeat 1-24 with egit
